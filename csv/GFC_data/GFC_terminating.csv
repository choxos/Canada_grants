Project activities include (1) providing technical assistance and support institutional reform to strengthen national mechanisms to promote equal employment opportunities for women; (2) providing skills for employment and entrepreneurship support to up to 6 000 women; and (3) providing training and technical assistance for media stakeholders on issues related to women’s work and their economic empowerment.,Terminating,2010-05-06	,2016-04-29	,"Pakistan: 100.00%",ILO - International Labour Organization ,"Vocational training: 68.86%;Democratic participation and civil society: 21.14%;Media and free flow of information: 10.00%","$8,000,000",,The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) strengthening national mechanisms to promote equal employment opportunities for women; (2) enhancing skills and employability of poor women in rural and urban areas in selected districts; and (3) strengthening the capacity of the media to raise awareness on issues related to working women.,Results achieved as of the end of the project (October 2016) include: (1) 9 281 women from low-income backgrounds completed vocational training  with over 80% of these graduates becoming employed; (2) over 1 500 women and men given specialized enterprise development training  leading to increased business development opportunities and an increase between 100% and 500% of their incomes; (3) 331 journalists from 35 districts across Pakistan completed training on Gender Responsive Reporting  resulting in over 100 news reports on women and labour issues; (4) advocacy from International Labour Organization and trained journalists helped push for the establishment of an online complaints mechanism to address workplace harassment under the Federal Ombudsman’s Office; and (5) five Gender Units were established under the provincial Department of Labour (DOL) in each of the provinces of Balochistan  Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa  Punjab  Sindh and for the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. These units helped institutionalize gender-responsive budgeting and decent work and labour inspection protocols. As a result  each provincial DOL was able to conduct gender-sensitive systematic labour inspections linked to relevant laws  such as the law against workplace harassment. Additionally  activities under the project (6) helped facilitate the registration of 200 home-based women workers with the Pakistan Workers’ Federation (PWF)  where they learned about workers’ rights  organizing and collective bargaining; and (7) approximately 367 DOL officials across all provinces were trained on gender mainstreaming concepts  such as gender-responsive budgeting  gender-responsive labour inspection  participatory gender audit methodology and analysis of labour force survey data to generate reports on market information and trends. These results have contributed to improving the income-earning opportunities and employment conditions for women and men across Pakistan  and to strengthen the capacities of provincial Departments of Labour in applying a gender lens to their analysis of market trends and the workforce  data collection and labour practices.

CA-3-A035111001,2025-09-19	,Nutritious Maize for Ethiopia,This project aims to improve household food security and nutrition in Ethiopia for an estimated 3.98 million people by promoting widespread adoption of Quality Protein Maize (QPM) varieties amongst growers and consumers of maize.  Also known as corn  maize is an essential food source for Ethiopians. QPM is a non-genetically engineered form of maize. The maize contains a naturally derived gene mutation of maize which has a higher content of two essential amino acids necessary to synthesize proteins within the human body after consumption  and provides twice as much nutritional value as common maize.  The project supports the adoption of QPM as well as increases in farm productivity and household incomes through the expansion of the maize seed industry. Project activities include: introducing QPM seed and food products to farmers (women and men) engaged in subsistence-level maize production as a means to meet household basic food requirements; disseminating gender-sensitive crop management practices to farmers and agricultural extension officers; and strengthening local capacity of researchers  seed producers  and seed suppliers on the production  distribution  and quality control of QPM seeds.  Nutritious Maize for Ethiopia (NuME) is an initiative of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT)  a member centre of the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research (CGIAR). CIMMYT is implementing the project in collaboration with the Ethiopian Institute for Agriculture Research  Ethiopia’s Ministry of Agriculture  Farm Radio International  a Canadian non-governmental organization  and Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG2000)  an international non-governmental organization.,Terminating,2012-03-05	,2020-12-15	,"Ethiopia: 100.00%",CIMMYT - International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ,"Basic nutrition: 60.00%;Food crop production: 20.00%;Agricultural research: 20.00%","$11,309,278",,The expected intermediate outcomes for this project include: 1. Increased utilization of Quality Protein Maize seed and grain  particularly by vulnerable groups with an emphasis on young children and women in maize-producing areas; 2. Increased Quality Protein Maize grain production in drought-prone and highland agro-ecological areas; 3. Strengthened institutional capacity of the public and private seed-supply sector to produce and distribute Quality Protein Maize seed on a sustainable basis.,Results achieved as of March 2017 include: (1) a total of 284 100 farmers  researchers  extension agents  local and regional government officials  and media personnel participated and learned about the nutritional benefits of quality protein maize (QPM) and how to increase its productivity during 1 594 farmer-focused learning events including field demonstrations (22% women managed)  field days and post-harvest demonstrations. The number of participants in farmer events far exceeds the original target of 20 000 for the whole project period; (2) training was provided to 639 farmers  health extension workers  nutritionists  and other government officials (38% male)  on how to prepare traditional foods such as bread and injera using QPM. The benefits of QPM based food were also demonstrated during 264 farmer events (25% women). Ten audio-visual modules in four languages on QPM food preparation were prepared and distributed. Following these promotional activities  five studies show consumers preference for white and yellow QPM food products over conventional white and yellow maize food products; (3) four regional radio stations were supported by Farm Radio International to broadcast (Participatory Radio Campaign) programs focusing on QPM’s nutritional benefits as well as effective agricultural techniques  post-harvest management  and use; and (4) approximately 1 504 tonnes of certified QPM seed were produced by private seed companies; 508 tonnes of which were produced in the last year. This seed has been certified by government examiners to contain better quality protein.

CA-3-D000402001,2025-09-19	,Scaling-up Birth Registration Using Innovative Technology,This project aims to register and issue birth certificates to 7 million girls and boys under the age of 5 (including 90% of newborns and 70% of previously unregistered children) in 26?regions of mainland Tanzania. Accurate birth registration allows the Government of Tanzania to effectively and efficiently plan for health  education  and child protection services and ensure that children have access to these services. The project supports the scaling up of an innovative birth registration system developed by Tanzania’s birth registration agency in partnership with Tigo (a mobile service provider). The system uses innovative technology that quickly uploads records of all birth registrations to a centralized system through text messages sent from mobile phones. This allows for real-time monitoring of birth registrations at national  regional and local levels and greatly simplifies the registration process.  Project activities include: (1) training local government registration agents on the gender-responsive simplified birth registration system  specifically health workers and Ward Executive Officers; (2) entering into a public-private partnership with key mobile service providers operating in the 26 regions; (3) conducting public awareness campaigns to support the implementation of the new birth registration system in each region; (4) assisting the Government of Tanzania to finalize the new Birth and Death Registration law; (5) coordinating an inter-ministerial committee on civil registration and vital statistics; and (6) training a core team of national facilitators to scale up the new birth registration system across mainland Tanzania.,Terminating,2015-01-19	,2023-12-29	,"Tanzania: 100.00%",UNICEF - United Nations Children's Fund ,"Population policy and administrative management: 18.35%;Population statistics and data: 65.32%;Statistical capacity building: 16.33%","$30,650,000",,The expected outcomes of this project include: (1) strengthened and established government management and oversight systems for birth registration; (2) increased certification of births for children under 5 in mainland Tanzania; (3) increased the government’s capacity to manage and monitor national gender-responsive simplified birth registration system; (4) improved availability of quality gender-responsive simplified birth registration services; and (5) increased use of gender-responsive simplified birth registration services by women and men  especially vulnerable mothers.,Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2023) include: (1) successfully implemented the Simplified Birth Registration System in all 26 regions on the Tanzanian mainland; (2) registered over 9.4 million births (50.9% boys and 49.1% girls); (3) increased access to birth registration  from 97 in 2013 to 11 376 registration centers across all regions; (4) trained 21 831 registration officers to deliver  a gender responsive simplified birth registration system; (5) developed a harmonized and integrated digital national registration system  which integrates the registration of all vital events and includes mobile application capabilities to allow public self-notification of events; and (6) supported streamlined birth registration efforts for children born to refugee parents  and young and adolescent mothers in Kagera and Kigoma regions.,Contributions to specific-purpose programmes and funds managed by implementing partners,Bilateral,Aid grant excluding debt reorganisation,,Global Affairs Canada,WGM Africa,Department-Initiated,1 - Gender equality; 2 - Children's issues; 1 - ICT as a tool for development;,,,"Budget Type:Original;Start Date:2014-04-01;End Date:2015-03-31;Value Date:2015-01-19;Value:"$2,200,000";Budget Type:Original;Start Date:2015-04-01;End Date:2016-03-31;Value Date:2015-01-19;Value:"$1,800,000";Budget Type:Original;Start Date:2016-04-01;End Date:2017-03-31;Value Date:2015-01-19;Value:"$1,900,000";Budget Type:Original;Start Date:2017-04-01;End Date:2018-03-31;Value Date:2015-01-19;Value:"$2,625,000";Budget Type:Original;Start Date:2018-04-01;End Date:2019-03-31;Value Date:2015-01-19;Value:"$1,750,000"","Geoname Code:149590;SRSName:http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326;GeoCoordinates:","Reference:2014200104;Other Identifier Type:CRS Activity identifier",

CA-3-D000577001,2025-09-19	,Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility for Central America - Honduras,The Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility for Central America (CRIFCA) provides natural disaster risk insurance coverage for Central American countries - this project focuses on Honduras. Central America is highly vulnerable to natural disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  and excess rainfall. Natural disasters typically disrupt economies  threaten the ability of a country to maintain essential services such as education  health and security  and jeopardize timely debt repayments. Natural disaster risk insurance is an essential tool to minimise the impact of natural disasters on a country's economy. The insurance provides countries with access to immediate financial payouts that are key to recovery and reconstruction efforts and that lessen the impact on ongoing poverty reduction efforts and the hard-won development gains of Central American countries.

CA-3-D002017001,2025-09-19	,Every Child Thrives in Côte d'Ivoire and Kenya,This project aims to serve children less than five years of age with vitamin A supplementation and de-worming programs in Côte d’Ivoire and Kenya. The mortality rate for children less than five years of age is 73/1000 live births in Kenya and 108/1000  in Côte d’Ivoire  in 2015. Vitamin A deficiency and worm infection causes and worsens malnutrition  anemia and diseases  particularly diarrheal diseases  which are a leading cause of death for children less than five years of age in these countries. Currently  these services are provided in both countries through schools  leaving children younger than five years unreached; a gap which this project is addressing. This project is providing improved delivery of these essential health services in communities where the actual coverage for children under five years of age is low.

CA-3-S065756001,2025-09-19	,Canadian International Food Security Research Fund - Phase II,The Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF) supports applied research projects that address food security challenges in the developing world. It is jointly funded  coordinated  and implemented in collaboration with the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and uses the combined expertise of both organizations to maximize the impact of the projects funded. Through investments in applied research  the CIFSRF contributes to the development of more productive  sustainable  and gender-sensitive agricultural techniques for women subsistence farmers  with the ultimate goal of making food sources more secure and accessible  and the food produced more nutritious  for poor households. Women and girls are particularly targeted by this project since they face the heaviest burden of chronic hunger and malnutrition in developing countries.  The objectives of the CIFSRF are: (1) to increase food security in developing countries by funding applied research in agricultural development and nutrition; (2) to apply Canadian science and technology expertise in collaboration with developing country partners to address food security; (3) to use research results to inform food security policies and programs; and (4) to identify innovations and scale up the most promising research from both Phase I and Phase II of the Fund to help meet future global food demand. Phase II focuses geographically on the 20 countries already targeted under Phase I as well as all other official development assistance-eligible countries in Africa.  Project activities for phase II include: (1) developing farming methods that can better withstand the effects of climate change; (2) developing environmentally sustainable gender-sensitive  farmer-led research models for breeding and distribution of new crops or underutilized traditional crops and consumption of sufficient  safe and nutritious food; (3) improving family-based aquaculture; (4) decreasing domestic animal losses through development of vaccines; and (5) reducing post-harvest losses through adaptable and affordable technologies.  Partnership is an important aspect of the CIFSRF and all the research projects funded are jointly conducted by Canadian and developing country-based organizations  such as academic institutions  private sector organizations  civil society organizations  or research institutions.

CA-3-P006383001,2025-09-19	,Strengthening Community Cohesion in Cox’s Bazar,The project aims to build the economic resilience and social cohesion for persons living in the host communities affected by the influx of displaced Rohingya people into Cox’s Bazar. Cox’s Bazar is one of Bangladesh’s poorest and most vulnerable districts  with poverty well above the country’s national average. The influx of over 740 000 Rohingya since August 2017 has increased economic tensions and competition for scarce resources  including for jobs and income  among the Rohingya and the host communities  as well as having a serious impact on local infrastructure and services. This situation poses a threat to peace and stability in the area  raising concerns about potential inter-communal or extremist violence which could have catastrophic implications  especially for women and children who are the most vulnerable.  The project aims to reduce the drivers of conflict and violence in Cox’s Bazar by providing skills training  employment support for women and young men in the host communities  and quick-impact community development projects to rehabilitate infrastructure and improve the safety and security of women and girls. To strengthen community cohesion  the project builds local capacity to address and defuse conflicts  including empowering women as community mediators and champions of peace.  Project activities are: (1) providing livelihood skills training for an estimated 1 000 women and 2 000 young men; (2) providing cash-for-work for an estimated 3 000 people to carry out quick impact community development projects  such as repairing infrastructure  rehabilitating public spaces and installing solar lighting to improve safety; (3) establishing a multi-purpose women’s centre for skills training for women and adolescent girls in the camps where Rohingya people have settled; (4) providing information on sexual and gender-based violence  and sexual and reproductive health and rights  human trafficking and child marriage to reach an estimated 6 000 women per year; (5) providing skills training for approximately 360 women per year; and (6) establishing a Local Volunteer Mediators Network.

Led by the Government of Ethiopia  with support from Canada and other partners  this initiative aims to enhance household and community resilience to shocks  such as droughts  and improve household food security  nutrition and economic well-being in Ethiopia's most vulnerable communities. To achieve these objectives  PSNP provides food insecure households with predictable food or cash transfers. In exchange for these transfers  PSNP beneficiaries participate in public works activities to build community assets and improve watershed management; a number of these activities build resilience to climate change. The most vulnerable beneficiaries (e.g. elderly people and pregnant and lactating mothers) receive transfers without contributing their labour for public works. The project reach is up to 10 million rural beneficiaries.  Project activities include: (1) providing cash and food transfers to food insecure households; (2) conducting livelihoods interventions (e.g. crop and livestock production  and off-farm income generating activities); (3) providing key health and nutrition services (e.g. behaviour change communication activities)  (4) construction of community assets (e.g. land rehabilitation  health posts); and (5) offering capacity development activities.

CA-3-P012004001,2025-09-19	,FSO Safer Oil Tanker Salvage Operation,This project seeks to prevent a catastrophic oil spill in the Red Sea. It aims to salvage and replace a decaying tanker off the coast of Yemen  near the port city of Hodeida. Production and offloading operations  suspended due to lengthy conflict in the area  prevented proper access and maintenance operations. This has resulted in the vessel decaying and loss of structural integrity. The tanker  FSO Safer  is at imminent risk of spilling  breaking apart or exploding. The UN has called on the international community to fund an emergency action plan to remove the oil from the tanker and replace the vessel. Project activities include: (1) providing ship-to-ship transfer of oil from the FSO Safer to the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC); (2) providing tank-cleaning and demucking; and (3) replacing the FSO with a floating CALM Buoy  permanently attached to a VLCC lightly modified to be an FSO.,Terminating,2022-09-06	,2023-12-31	,"Yemen: 100.00%",UNDP - United Nations Development Programme ,"Multi-hazard response preparedness: 100.00%","$2,500,000",,The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) averting a humanitarian and environmental disaster that would impact the livelihoods and food security for millions of people in Yemen; and (2) advancing peace efforts in the region by incentivizing parties involved in the Yemen conflict to reach an agreement as part of a formal peace process.,Results achieved at the end of the project (December 2023) include: (1) contracted  mobilized  and deployed salvage assets to the FSO Safer site.
