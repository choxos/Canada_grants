A Django-based web application that provides transparency into Canadian government grants and contributions, helping citizens understand how their tax dollars are being spent.

## Features

### üèõÔ∏è Grant Database

### üßÆ Tax Contribution Calculator
**The most innovative feature** - Calculate your personal contribution to each grant:

1. **Input Your Finances**:
   - Annual income (before tax)
   - GST-eligible spending (goods/services with tax)

2. **Automatic Calculation**:
   - Federal income tax using 2024 brackets

   - Total tax contribution

3. **Personal Grant Shares**:
   - Your exact dollar contribution to each grant
   - Percentage of your income going to specific projects
   - Share of controversial grants like international development

**Example**: If you earn $75,000 and pay $15,000 in federal taxes, you contributed approximately $0.75 to a $20M grant (your tax share √ó grant amount √∑ total federal revenue).
